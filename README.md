# Scan & Cook

Shopping often means wasting time and money. Many times, we end up walking around the supermarket several times before reaching the checkout. We often leave without actually getting what we needed. There are too many choices, and we don’t always know what to pick. Product competition is everywhere, and we don’t always have the time to compare everything. According to INSEE, the French spend an average of 2 hours and 30 minutes per week shopping, time that could be managed more efficiently.

Scan & Cook is the new app that helps you optimize the way you shop. The app suggests healthy, quick, and efficient recipes for you. All the user has to do is choose their recipes for the week, and a shopping list is automatically generated. To check off items on the list, the user simply scans a product, and the app validates whether the ingredient is part of the list and updates it accordingly.
